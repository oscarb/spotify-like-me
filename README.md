# Spotify Like Me

One `GET` request to like the playing track and add the album tracks to various playlists, just _like me_ whenever an awesome track shows up on Spotify.

Whenever the `/like` endpoint is requested, the server will:

* Add the currently playing Spotify track to the library, i.e. put a ðŸ’š on it
* Add all the tracks from the same album to a seasonal playlist (_Fall 2021_, _Winter 2021_...) and create the playlist if it doesn't already exist
* Add all the tracks from the same album to the playlists configured in `./config.js`
